# Run Buddy, Inc

## Purpose
A website that offers fitness training services. This project spanned the first two lessons of our bootcamp, where we were introduced to HTML and CSS. The User Story is that if someone is looking to get into running, they would come to this website for information on trainers and programs. We had to build the page from scratch, and I remember enjoying this project
