# Run Buddy, Inc

## Purpose
A website that offers fitness training services. This project spanned the first two lessons of our bootcamp, where we were introduced to HTML and CSS. The User Story is that if someone is looking to get into running, they would come to this website for information on trainers and programs. We had to build the page from scratch, and I remember enjoying this project

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS

## What did I learn during this lesson?
- How to interact with the computer's file system by using the command line
- Created an HTML document in VS Code
- Applied meaning, context, and functionality to HTML elements by using HTML attributes
- Interpreted a mock-up given to us by designers by dividing it into sections (or containers), so we could create organized HTML content
- Used git to create a repository for the project and create reassuring save points throughout the build process
- Used Github to create a remote location for the repository, and then published the project to Github pages for others to see
- Applied style and layout to HTML content by using CSS, leaning about its syntax, rules and quirks
- Used the knowledge gained from building RUn Buddy landing page to creat a Privacy Policy page
